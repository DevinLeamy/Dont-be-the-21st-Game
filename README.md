# Dont-be-the-21st-Game
This is my First Android Studios Project  <br/>
I tried to replicate a 2 player numbers game I've played called 21. The game starts at 0 and goes to 21. In turns, each player adds 1, 2 or 3 to the current counter the objective of the game being to make the other player say 21.  <br/> Simple right.

Attached are the source code files and the activities (.xml files) they control.
